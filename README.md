     ```bash
     API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
     ```
   - Optionally, you can specify a custom port for the application. If no port is provided, the default port (`3000`) will be used:
     ```bash
     PORT=your_preferred_port_number # Optional, default is 3000
     ```

5. **Run the Application:**
